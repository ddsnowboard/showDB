showDB
======

Shows a sqlite3 database visually. Soon, it will probably have the capability to edit the database, but right now
I'm just focusing on showing. It will have the ability to run on any database, with the help of a file picker dialog, 
and it will be able to be run as a program in itself, or copied to the same directory as your own program, imported, and 
run that way, and maybe even from the console with a command for the target database. You'll be able to choose which rows of
the database are shown, and it will save it in some sort of config file for later. It'll open the same way as last time, 
but you'll be able to override this and open a new database or edit the columns shown.
